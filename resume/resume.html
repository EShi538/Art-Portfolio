<p><strong> </strong><strong>Awards:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Dr. Bob Berman Disruptive Engineering Award&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>From MIT BWSI&nbsp;</li>
<li>13 out of ~400 nominated for this award</li>
<li>&nbsp;Awarded to those two gave outstanding contributions to their cohort and program as a whole, and for demonstrating outstanding engineering/innovation skill&nbsp;</li>
<li>The stated reason for my selection is this: <em>&ldquo;Eric receives the Disruptive Innovation award for his dual abilities to make machines learn and to help his fellow humans learn how to make machines learn. He was friendly and effective at getting his own team and other teams to successfully tackle some of the hardest material in the course&rdquo;</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>USACO Gold</li>
<ol>
<li>USA Coding Olympiad gold division</li>
<li>Very difficult to get into, silver is generally seen as a bottleneck</li>

<li>AP Scholar with Distinction (for achieving an average score of at least 3.5 on all AP Exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on five or more AP exams)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Service:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mural Project&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>1125 sq. feet</li>
<li>Located at back of the school facing the parking lot and Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road</li>
<li>~250+ hours spent by me individually</li>
<li>&nbsp;I handled all materials; This meant I spent the most hours on the project because the team could only paint if I was there</li>
<li>&nbsp;I also designed the layout/composition digitally, combining each team member&rsquo;s ideas; This layout made it onto the final wall</li>
</ol>
<li>TA-ing for digital art summer camp (35 Hours total over span of 1 week)</li>
<li>SUSD TA-ing for jumpstart program (4 hours/day, 5 days/week, 3 weeks)</li>
<li>Tour guide and setup help at Saratoga History Museum (7 hours/day, one day service)</li>
<li>Hunger At Home Head Marketing Designer (2 Hours/day, 1 day/week, 26 weeks/year)</li>
<ol>
<li>Created weekly graphics/infographics/fliers for Hunger at Home Club and Youth Council, an organization spanning many high schools across the Bay Area</li>

<li>Past Projects:&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interactive mirror (2020-2021):</strong> A 10x10 array of mirror modules. Each module contained a tiltable mirror connected to a servo motor in a laser cut box and press fit components. On the top there is a camera that sends information to code that separates any humanoids in the camera frame from the background using Human detection AI algorithm with OpenCV. The code then grids out the camera frame into a 10x10 grid (so it is in parity with the actual mirror wall &ldquo;dimensions&rdquo;) and then determines a gray-scale value for each grid section. Each grid square&rsquo;s gray-scale value is converted to an angle of which to tilt each grid square&rsquo;s corresponding mirror module. All together, with all of the components working in harmony, the mirror wall can create patterns replicating the humanoids captured in the camera frame and their movements in real time. The tilting mirrors create this illusion by manipulating the lighting, creating darker and lighter grid squares to &ldquo;draw out&rdquo; the patterns.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Wings(2021-2022): </strong>We decided to do something more artistic and made a pair of retractable wings that could be strapped on humans and dogs alike. We cut and connected pieces of plywood to create the frame and then attached feathers on it in a nice looking manner that makes it look like a real pair of wings.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive mirror Part II (2022-2023):</strong> In this, we aimed to improve on the original prototype because the original mirror wall was functional, but very clunky and almost impossible to move around without significant effort expenditure. In the new version, we 3-D printed the frame, instead of laser cutting and press fitting the frame. We also used command strips to stick the frame to the board, rather than glue and wires. Furthermore, our wire management was a lot more organized, allowing for easy fixing. Finally, we attached the mirror wall to some wheels for easy transport.</li>
<li><strong>Interactive LED Board (Modular) (2023 Summer):</strong> In this project, we created an interactive LED board that is modular. Input was taken on a phone, where the user could draw something with their finger, and then the data was sent from the iphone to an arduino and then to a LED board that&rsquo;s wired up to the arduino board. The LED would then mirror the pattern the user inputted on the phone. The colors are customizable and it can create pre-set patterns too. It also has a clear function to erase the LED board.</li>

<p><strong>Academic Experiences/Classes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>MIT BWSI&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>Extremely Competitive; single digit admit rate</li>
<li>400 students selected nationwide</li>
<li>Joined the Serious Game Design with AI, a 30 student cohort</li>
<li>I created a serious game from the bottom up which aims to research AI ethical decision making vs. human ethical decision making in the context of a high stakes environment, specifically a highly infectious and dangerous disease. In this project, I created my own slightly adapted reinforcement learning algorithm from scratch to compete against human players so we could answer our research questions.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<li>UCLA Art|Sci Pre-college program</li>
<li>Research with UMich Professor&nbsp;</li>
<ol>
<li>Lesion visualization with Python and VTK (11th grade)</li>
<li>Working with a U. Michigan professor (Professor Hadjyski), I wrote a python program that reconstructs a volume render of a directory of medical scans. It quickly and efficiently renders an interactive 3D model of the human body and its innards using segmentation data. It can highlight potential lesions and is fully zoomable and rotatable.&nbsp;</li>
